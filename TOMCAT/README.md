# APACHE TOMCAT & HOSTING A JAVA APPLICATION ON TOMCAT

Apache is an open-source application-based web server. It allows client-server interaction to run smoothly. From processing request for images, videos, texts, etc and bundling it into browser compatible format before being displayed to the user.

In this section, I will be learning how to setup a web server on a virtual machine. By incorporating the knowledge from the previous section (Maven), I will be using MAVEN to package a java web application into a .war file which we are going to deploy on the Apache web server. The result of this will be a webpage that we can access via `localhost:8080`

```
Summary

1. Create a server
2. Use Maven to package the java application into a .war file
3. Move the package into the server
4. Run and access the webpage via port 8080

```
